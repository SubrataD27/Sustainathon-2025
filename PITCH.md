# Project Kavach | One-Page Pitch
**Team Tejas - Sustainathon 2025 | Cybersecurity & Digital Trust**

---

## üöÄ The Problem We Solve

**Drone threats are escalating rapidly:** 95% increase in security incidents, $52B market by 2025, yet existing solutions are either military-grade overkill or reactive civilian tools that lack trust verification.

Current solutions fail at **autonomous decision-making** with **verifiable accountability**.

## üí° Our Innovation: Trust-First Autonomous Defense

**Project Kavach** is the first autonomous airspace defense platform that cryptographically proves every decision through an immutable ledger while optimizing for civilian deployment and sustainable operations.

### Core Value Proposition
> *"Autonomous defense actions you can trust, with quantifiable risk mitigation and forensic-grade evidence"*
