# KAVACH - Autonomous Drone Defense System | Team Tejas
## Proactive Airspace Defense Platform with Trust-First Architecture

### Executive Summary

KAVACH is a comprehensive, autonomous drone defense system designed to detect, classify, and safely neutralize unauthorized drones in critical airspace. The system employs a multi-layered approach combining advanced sensor fusion, AI/ML-powered threat classification, and autonomous interception capabilities.

### Core Value Proposition

**Multi-Modal Detection**: Advanced sensor fusion combining RF detection, Doppler radar, and optical sensors for 360-degree airspace monitoring with minimal false positives.

**Autonomous Interception**: High-speed K-Interceptor drone with AI-guided terminal approach and safe net-capture system for physical containment.

**Trust-First Security**: Every action, detection, and response is cryptographically logged in an immutable hash-chain ledger, ensuring complete audit trails and tamper-evident operations.

**Human-Supervised Autonomy**: Advanced AI provides instant threat assessment while maintaining human oversight for critical decisions, balancing speed with accountability.

**Adaptive Defense**: Dynamic risk scoring and operational mode adjustment based on threat landscape, environmental conditions, and energy optimization.

## 📋 Demo Script (Judge Walkthrough)

### Opening Statement (20 seconds)
"Project Kavach is a proactive, trust-first autonomous airspace defense platform. It detects, classifies, and neutralizes hostile drones in real-time, responds with an interceptor workflow, and cryptographically proves every action through a tamper-evident ledger—while optimizing energy and quantifying avoided risk."

### Interactive Demo Flow
1. **Generate Scenario** → Seeds multi-class threats (RF/visual fusion simulated)
2. **Spatial View** → Live threat markers, drone path visualization
3. **Adaptive Mode Badge** → HIGH_ALERT/NORMAL/ECO based on threat activity
4. **Risk Gauge** → 0-100 composite score (unauthorized count + confidence + incidents)
5. **Ledger Integrity** → "Simulate Corrupt Ledger" demonstrates tamper detection
6. **Evidence Export** → One-click forensic bundle (ZIP download)
7. **Airspace Whitelist** → Remote ID authorization management
