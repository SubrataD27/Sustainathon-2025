# KAVACH - Autonomous Drone Defense System
## Technical Specification & Implementation Plan

### Executive Summary
KAVACH is a comprehensive, autonomous drone defense system designed to detect, classify, and safely neutralize unauthorized drones in critical airspace. The system employs a multi-layered approach combining advanced sensor fusion, AI/ML-powered threat classification, and autonomous interception capabilities.

## 1. Comprehensive System Architecture

The KAVACH system is built on a multi-layered, distributed architecture designed for resilience, scalability, and rapid, automated response. It consists of four primary layers: the Perception Layer, the Communication Layer, the Command & Control (C2) Layer, and the Response Layer.

### Hardware Layer

#### Multi-Modal Sensor Nodes
**Purpose:** To form a distributed grid that provides 360-degree, all-weather airspace monitoring.

**Components:**
- **RF Detector:** A software-defined radio (SDR) or dedicated spectrum analyzer tuned to common drone frequencies (e.g., 433MHz, 900MHz, 2.4GHz, 5.8GHz) to detect control and video links.
- **Doppler Radar:** A low-power 24GHz K-band radar module to detect the presence, velocity, and approximate size (Radar Cross-Section) of moving objects, effective against autonomous drones without an active RF link.
- **Optical Sensor:** A high-resolution PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) camera that can be automatically cued by RF or radar detections for visual confirmation and evidence gathering.
- **Processing Unit:** An edge computing device like a Raspberry Pi 4 or NVIDIA Jetson Nano for on-site data pre-processing.
- **Power & Comms:** Solar panel with battery backup for autonomous operation and a LoRaWAN module for low-power, long-range data backhaul.

#### Autonomous Interceptor Drone ("K-Interceptor")
**Purpose:** The physical effector designed for high-speed interception and safe containment.

**Specifications:**
- **Airframe:** A lightweight carbon fiber quadcopter frame designed for high thrust-to-weight ratio, enabling speeds >120 km/h.
- **Flight Controller:** A Pixhawk or similar open-source flight controller running PX4/ArduPilot for robust flight stabilization and autonomous navigation.
- **Onboard AI Computer:** An NVIDIA Jetson module to run real-time object tracking algorithms (e.g., YOLOv5, SiamMask) for terminal guidance.
- **Primary Payload:** An electronically triggered, lightweight net-capture system designed to entangle and secure the target drone.
- **Sensors:** High-resolution FPV and optical zoom cameras, GPS/GNSS module, IMU, and barometer for resilient navigation.

#### Drone Docking Station
**Purpose:** To house, protect, and automatically charge the K-Interceptor, ensuring it is always ready for deployment.

**Features:** Weatherproof enclosure, automated launch/recovery platform, and an auto-aligning charging interface.

#### Central Command & Control (C2) Server
**Purpose:** The central brain of the operation, housing the main software and AI/ML core.

**Hardware:** A rack-mounted server with sufficient CPU cores for data processing, a powerful GPU (e.g., NVIDIA A100 or RTX 4090) for AI model training and inference, and SSD storage.

## 2. Software, AI & Communication Layers

### Sensor Node Software
Lightweight firmware running on the edge device to process raw sensor data, filter noise, and transmit condensed alert packets over LoRaWAN to minimize bandwidth usage.

### Command & Control (C2) Platform
- **Backend:** A microservices architecture built with Python (Flask/FastAPI). Services include sensor data ingestion, AI processing, a database service, and an API for the user interface.
- **Database:** InfluxDB for storing high-volume, time-series sensor data and PostgreSQL for relational data like incident reports and whitelisted device information.
- **Frontend:** A web-based dashboard built with React providing a real-time map of the airspace, alert notifications, video feeds, and incident management tools.
- **Communication Protocol:** MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is used for lightweight, real-time messaging between the C2 server, sensor gateways, and the interceptor drone.

### AI/ML Core
- **Sensor Fusion Engine:** A Kalman filter algorithm fuses positional data from RF triangulation, radar tracks, and optical sensors to create a single, highly accurate "State Vector" (position, velocity, acceleration) for each tracked object, significantly reducing false positives.
- **Threat Classification Model:** A two-stage model. First, a Random Forest classifier analyzes RF signal characteristics to identify the likely drone protocol (e.g., Wi-Fi, OcuSync, Lightbridge). Second, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) like YOLOv5 analyzes the video feed to visually confirm the object is a drone and classify its type.
- **Whitelist Verification:** The classified drone's signature and flight path are checked against a database of authorized flights (e.g., registered security drones, approved deliveries) to make the final "friend or foe" determination.

## 3. Working Principle & Methodology

The KAVACH system operates on a proactive "Containment Chain" model, an automated workflow designed for safety and legal compliance, replacing the traditional military "kill chain."

### 1. Detect & Track (Seconds 0-2)
- An unauthorized drone enters the protected airspace. The RF sensors immediately detect its control signal, and the radar picks up its physical presence.
- The C2 server's Sensor Fusion Engine correlates the data streams, initiates a track, and discounts environmental noise (like birds) that would only trigger one sensor type.

### 2. Classify & Verify (Seconds 2-4)
- The C2 system automatically cues the nearest PTZ camera to the drone's location for visual data.
- The AI/ML core analyzes the combined RF, radar, and visual data to classify the drone type and compares it against the authorized whitelist.
- An alert is raised on the C2 dashboard with all relevant data: drone type, location, speed, and threat level.

### 3. Automated Response (Seconds 4-5)
- If the drone is confirmed as unauthorized and hostile based on pre-defined rules (e.g., entering a no-fly zone, exhibiting anomalous behavior), the C2 system automatically sends a launch command to the K-Interceptor's docking station. A human operator can override this step if required ("human on the loop").

### 4. Intercept & Contain (Seconds 5-60)
- The K-Interceptor launches and flies autonomously towards the target's live coordinates, receiving real-time track updates from the C2 system.
- During the final approach, the interceptor's onboard AI uses its optical sensor for terminal guidance, ensuring a precise intercept even if the target is evasive.
- Once in optimal range, the interceptor deploys its net, physically entangling the rogue drone.

### 5. Secure & Analyze (Post-Intercept)
- The K-Interceptor transports the captured drone to a designated safe zone for retrieval.
- The entire incident, including all sensor data, flight paths, and video evidence, is logged and compiled into a forensic report for legal prosecution and analysis.
